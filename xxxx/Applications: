Skills

In the terms of technology, my tools of trades are HTML5, CSS3, SASS, PostCSS, JavaScript (ES6/ES7) and version system Git. I also like to work with Bootstrap and Foundation frameworks, NodeJS platform and OOP. When I want to use some JavaScript library, it is ReactJS and jQuery. I like to use build tool Gulp and bundler Webpack.

I'm devoted to modern and clean designs. I am an advocate of structure, purity and simplicity in both, design and code. Beautiful is better than ugly. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. I believe that every line of code and element in design has to have purpose or function. Organization and consistency are very important to me.
